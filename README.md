# Simple Shell

## Description

This project focuses on creating a shell, whirch is a command interpreter program for unix-based operating systems.
The shell allows the user to communicate with the operating system interactively through the commands that the user enters.
Its function is to read the command line, interpret its meaning, carry out the command, and then output the result via the outputs.
To carry out this project, the c language was used.
